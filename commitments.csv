1,Re-establish a grazing system to adjust for lost pasture,Pasture,N,Y,N,N,Plan developed by Q4 2017,"OT built its mine atop pasture lands where herders used to graze their animals. With the loss of this land, pasture is more scarce.","This commitment is DELAYED. An updated pasture use plan has not yet been approved by the Soum Khural. A professional organization developed a recommendation for pasture management. However, when it presented this plan at Bagh meetings, the major recommendation to divide herders into pasture “user groups” was rejected by herders.  To fulfill this commitment, the TPC must continue their efforts to re-establish a grazing system, working in close consultation with herders to develop a pasture use plan that meets their needs. In April of 2020, the TPC developed an action plan to do consultations with herders in the near future with the goal of educating herders on the pasture management plan and generate ideas specific to the Gobi desert.  This measure is needed to address ongoing issues with pasture crowding and should be coordinated with related commitments to build new wells (#12) particularly in areas where it could open up additional pastures (#3).",delayed
2,Reduce herder actions to lock wells / limit pasture access (signed user contracts),Pasture,Y,N/A,N,N,237 signed contracts by Q3 2017,"The OT mine's use of water and pasture lands has increased pressure on herders for these important resources. In order to protect increasingly scarce water and pasture, some herders had resorted to locking state-owned wells and restricting access to land. The Khanbogd Soum government with support from the TPC committed to sign contracts with 237 herders to ensure free and open access to state owned water points and land.","This commitment is DELAYED. The original timeline in the agreement called for contracts to be signed with all users of state owned water access points by Q3 2017. Contract language has been approved by the TPC.  However, the government’s plan clarified that contracts will only apply to engineered or deep wells (not shallow or hand wells).  As of the publishing of this update, no contracts have been signed yet.",delayed
3,Open additional pasture use through well building program (#12); clarify herder rights to possession,Pasture,N,N/A,N,N,Irrigate all reserve pastures by 2018,"To address increased scarcity of water and pasture, the Khanbogd Soum government with support from OT agreed to build new wells on reserve pastureland (see commitment #12), with a goal to make more pastureland accessible for regular use by herders. These changes were to be reflected in a Soum government pasture irrigation policy and pasture use plan (see commitment #1). This commitment also includes clarifying herders' rights to possession regarding any new wells built.",This commitment is NOT YET STARTED. The commitment called for the irrigation of all possible reserve pastures by 2018. The reserve pastures have still not been identified.  The TPC plans to identify reserve pastures and work towards building deep wells in those areas.  The TPC should ensure that wells built carry out their intended purpose to open up additional land to herding.      ,not_started
4,"Support local government on pasture management (technical trainings, provision of experts)",Pasture,Y,Y,Y,N,Send 5 experts to trainings by Q3 2017,"The Soum government, as a significant partner in the implementation of the agreements, committed to pursuing technical trainings of its staff on pasture and other related issues to build the local capacity of the governmen to support implementation of the agreements.","This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The original commitment called for five experts to be trained by Q3 of 2017. The Soum government has 5 staff positions that should be trained in pasture management, however, only one person was available for work when we visited in June 2019. Of the three staff hired to the Agricultural Department, two were on maternity leave. The government had to wait until October 2019 to hire two additional agricultural specialists in order to give them time to pass the public servant examination.  Given changes in local government staffing, two  additional specialists will need to trained to ensure the unit is sufficiently staffed with five trained experts.",in_progress
5,"TPC to actively support herders, existing institutions, and traditional ways to resolve herding conflicts",Pasture,N,N/A,N,N,Q3 2017,"In response to rising and at times violent disputes among herders related to water and pasture use, the Soum Governor issued a decree on open access to water points and prohibition on use of winter pastures during summer months. Under Mongolia law, water and pasture are generally for public use. It was thought that more was needed from the government to enforce the law and prevent restrictions on access.  This commitment seeks to support herders in settling disputes about water and pasture using traditional and other mechanisms and requires the TPC to actively promote enforcement of the governor's decree.","This commitment is NOT YET STARTED. It was thought that a resolution must be passed to help enforce the governor's decree, but trying to pass enforcement actions, such as fining those who restrict access to water points and pasture, is difficult to implement. As an alternative, herder representatives to the TPC agreed to organize a campaign to promote the soum governor’s decree.  The TPC should actively engage on support mechanisms to help herders resolve disputes.",not_started
6,Document and secure herder customary land and resource use rights (camp cadaster),Pasture,Y,N?,Y,Y,2018,"The government agreed to support herders to secure customary land rights by organizing a camp cadaster entry campaign. When herders register their camp, including any structures, in the cadaster, they receive a property certificate. This in turn allows herders to access credit by using their property as collateral.","This commitment was IN PROGRESS in 2019 and close to completion. The government organized a campaign in each bagh to complete the cadaster. As of April 2020, 373 herders (or about 80% of all registered herders) had their winter and spring camps mapped and registered.  Not all herders who requested registration of their camps had their camps included in the cadaster but any herder who still wants their camp mapped may do so by making a request at the government’s office in the Soum center.   ",in_progress
7,Detailed analysis of increased livestock numbers and absentee livestock ownership,Pasture,N,N,Y,N,List of livestock owners by Q4 2017,"As livestock numbers continue to rise, this puts greater urgency on the local government and herders to understand the growth in livestock and develop solutions for managing limited resources of pasture and water necessary for the livestock's survival. The government committed to carrying out a more detailed analysis of livestock numbers and “absentee owners” who hire other people to look after their herds. The stated goal was to achieve a clear understanding  ","This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The government was supposed to have completed counting the livestock owning citizens in Q4 of 2017. The government has done this and now conducts an annual survey of livestock herded by others. However, it has not conducted any analysis, and is at the moment only monitoring livestock numbers.",in_progress
8,Consider and decide whether to build speed bumps around animal crossings on ОТ-KB road,Pasture,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,This commitment was discussed in the TPC and all parties agreed it was not necessary to implement this commitment.,N/A,
9,Rehabilitate pasture in sites disturbed by past OT activities,Pasture,Y,Y,Y,N,2017-2027 in phases,"OT agreed to rehabilitate eight sites that were previously used by the mine. The purpose of rehabilitating these sites is to restore them to pasture-producing land, to shorten the time that these sites might produce dust if disturbed and to minimize risks of accidents in quarries.","This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The time originally estimated for completing rehabilitation is 2017 to 2027. OT regularly reports to the TPC on rehabilitation progress, which for some areas will take years to complete.",in_progress
10,Continue to implement 2015 protocol allowing temporary livestock grazing within OT fence,Water,Y,N/A,Y,Y,Ongoing,"When OT built its mine, it placed a fence around its production facilities and prevented herders from grazing their animals on their usual pastures. With this commitment, OT agreed to allow herders to continue grazing their animals in certain areas within the fenced production site of OT. OT has stated in the agreement that this is a temporary situation and the grazing area may not be available for use in the future once mine expansion plans get underway.",This commitment is COMPLETED. This is an ongoing commitment and TPC should continue to monitor whether the area inside the fence is available for grazing and whether herders are aware of the option to use this grazing area.,completed
11,Request national government to allocate 50% of OT's water use fee to KB Soum Government,Water,N,N,N,N,Receive response by Q3 2017,"The government of Mongolia charges a fixed rate to mining companies for the water they use in their operations. This ""water use fee"" is paid to the national government, which distributes a portion to the national budget, and a portion to the aimag, provincial government, where the mine is located. The aimag then apportions that money across the soums in its territories. Though the herders and citizens of Khanbogd soum are the ones most impacted by OT's mining activities and use of local water resources, they receive a disproportionately low percentage of the water use fee paid by OT. Both OT and the Khanbogd soum government agreed to lobby to request that 50% of the water use fee paid by OT gets re-allocated back to Khanbogd soum.","This commitment is DELAYED. The Khanbogd government submitted a letter to the aimag citizen’s khural in support of an amendment to the law that would distribute 50% of OT's water use fee to the local soum. Unfortunately, there has been no response at the national or aimag level to pass the legislation needed to make this change.  Getting additional support to the soum government is vitally important to accomplish other commitments in the Agreements (most notably to implement the soum’s Animal Husbandry Sector Development Program commitment #34).  It is unclear whether OT and the Khanbogd Soum can find a way to get more of the water use fee to go to the soum or possibly find another way to get more resources to the soum.",delayed
12,"Construct new hand wells across 4 baghs, based on findings of hydrological studies (see #17)*",Water,Y,Y,N,N,Begin well construction in 2018,"OT agreed to build new hand wells across the soum as a form of collective compensation to herders. The exact number of wells was to be determined by the TPC based on hydrological studies to ensure that wells would be productive and would not affect water levels of existing wells. The agreement further states that the well locations should incorporate input from herders and should be dispersed across the four baghs to encourage migration and use of alternate pastures and allow herders to continue their customary livelihood practices. An independent joint fact-finding report [link] commissioned by the TPC and published in January of 2017, whose findings were the basis of the Final Agreement commitments, recommended that 75+ hand wells would be needed to address herders’ water needs.","This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The agreement contemplated a new well construction program beginning in 2018 after completion of a hydrological study. Instead of financing the construction of wells directly, OT submitted a request for funding through the Gobi Oyu Development Support Fund (DSF)[link], an aimag-wide fund for community development projects to which OT contributes $5 million annually. The governing body of the Gobi Oyu Development Support Fund has many stakeholders with competing interests. DSF approved the Chandmani Erdene project to conduct a hydrological study to find water pools on non-irrigated land. The scope of this project, however, was expanded across four soums in the South Gobi aimag and is not solely focused on Khanbogd soum and implementation of this commitment. As a result, the funding and scope for this project are limited and it only contemplates building 12 new wells in Khanbogd Soum (6 deep wells; 1 solar powered well; 5 hand wells). This falls far short of the 75+ hand wells recommended by the independent study. As of the writing of this report, the 12 new wells were constructed, but it is not clear that they are being built in a manner that encourages migration and use of alternate pastures as specified by the agreement .  Given that a full hydrological study was never undertaken to establish how many new wells are needed to meet herder water needs in Khanbogd soum, it is not clear how TPC will assess whether the new wells are sufficient, or whether they will consider further action to address herders’ water needs beyond the 12 wells provided through the Chandmani Erdene Project.",in_progress
13,"Establish well maintenance team to build, repair and monitor condition of wells (see # 37)",Water,N,Y,N,N,Proof of restored wells by Q4 2017,"Many current wells have not been renovated since the early 1990s. Herders are able to do annual or biannual removal of mud from shallow wells, but deep wells are difficult for herders to maintain on their own. OT agreed to collaborate with the Khanbogd soum government to set up a well maintenance team, which would also benefit herders by providing them employment.","This commitment is DELAYED. The agreement timeline originally contemplated reporting of results of restored wells by Q4 of 2017. The commitment has been delayed because of a lack of capacity within the TPC to develop options for how to structure the well maintenance program. After heavy rains in 2018, six herder cooperatives were hired to conduct emergency repairs of 40 wells.  TheTPC is looking to the Chandmani Erdene Project  to continue making repairs of wells.  However, the Chandmani Erdene project repaired only 1 deep well and 10 hand wells in 2018 and 2019.    The TPC discussed the need for well maintenance to begin in the Spring of 2020, but it’s unclear what additional actions beyond relying on the Chandmani Erdene project will be taken to fulfill this commitment.  The TPC responded that an additional 10-15 wells will be repaired under the Chandmani Erdene project in 2020 and that a closed tender would be organized among the businesses in Khanbogd soum to repair the wells and the khoroo.",delayed
14,Gradually stop OT water delivery after resolving new well creation needs,Water,N,N/A,Y,Y,2018,"There is a wide-held belief among herders that water levels in wells and well recharge rates have decreased in part due to OT's use of local water resources. During negotiations about the herders’ CAO complaints, OT began delivering water tanks to 5 designated locations, to serve herder households who did not have sufficient access to water from local wells. OT agreed to continue delivering water to these households until they obtained sufficient access to water through the construction of new wells as contemplated in commitment #12.","This commitment is COMPLETED. The original timeline noted that the temporary delivery should stop once new wells were built based on commitment #12. TPC agreed that OT would temporarily stop its delivery of water after heavy rains in 2018 made the water deliveries unnecessary for most households receiving this benefit. Though the well-building effort (commitment #12) is still in progress, OT decided to build wells at six water points to provide a sustainable alternative to the water deliveries. The TPC established a working group consisting of members of the Aimag Food and Agriculture Department, the Governor's Office of Khanbogd Soum, the TPC, the well-building company, the herders who own the wells, and members of the Galba Oosh Dolood Basin Administration to assess the performance and quality of the wells.  There were problems with two of the water points not producing sufficient water.  In response to these issues, OT agreed to rebuild one of the wells and continues to provide water deliveries at another water point .",completed
15,Close all leaking boreholes in Gunii Khooloi area; equip 2 fountaining boreholes for herders’ water use,Water,Y,Y,Y,Y,2016,"This commitment included closing all leaking boreholes in the Gunii Khooloi area.  This was important to herders, as some OT boreholes had previously been found to leak water from shallow aquifers that herders rely on into deeper aquifers used by OT, contributing to an unknown amount of water loss. OT also agreed to equip 2 boreholes for use by herders, and equipping two boreholes to enable herders to use them for household water needs.","This commitment was COMPLETED in March 2019. OT has now sealed a total of 55 old exploration boreholes, in collaboration with Khanbogd soum, South Gobi aimag and the TPC. All sealed boreholes have been officially handed over to the Galba-Uush Doloodiin river basin authority and the Khanbogd Soum government.",completed
16,"Provide 12 boreholes, equipped for herder water use, to KB Government",Water,Y,Y,Y,Y,Q3 2017,OT agreed to hand over 12 exploration boreholes in the Gunii Khooloi area (in addition to the 2 in commitment #15) and Galbyn Gobi to the Khanbogd Soum government for use by local herders for their pastoral water supply needs.,This commitment was COMPLETED in March 2019. ,completed
17,Hydrogeological study (study of water reserves under pasture)*,Monitoring,Y,Y,Y,N,Q2-Q3 2017,"The parties originally agreed that OT would fund a hydrological study that would map the water reserves under pastures in Khanbogd Soum and provide the basis for implementing the new well-building program. This was based on the recommendation of the Multi-Disciplinary Team and Independent Expert Panel (MDT/IEP) Joint Fact Finding Report published in 2017.  The TPC was to define the Terms of Reference of the study. The goal of this study was to quantify OT’s current and future impacts on water by providing an understanding of shallow groundwater dynamics on which herders depend, by strengthening modelling, and by measuring changes in water resources.","This commitment is DELAYED. Because the geophysical survey and well building are being paid for and implemented through the Gobi Oyu Social Development Fund, this commitment has been subjected to a longer process that is not in the control of the TPC or the parties. This commitment has now been rolled into a larger project to improve pasture watering across four soums. It is unclear how the geophysical survey will be conducted, whether it will cover the full territory of Khanbogd Soum or only limited areas around each planned water point, or what information such a survey will be able to provide.  With so many unknowns and so few decisions in the hands of the TPC, it is far from clear whether this commitment will achieve its intended purpose.",delayed
18,Replace outsourced environmental monitoring with local monitoring; include paid positions for herders*,Monitoring,Y,Y,Y,N,Begin to implement in January 2018,"There have been many disputes between herders and OT about the reliability of OT's environmental monitoring data. For example, OT and herders have long disagreed on whether the mine has had an impact on water resources used by herders. The parties agreed to establish a participatory monitoring program, in which herders could independently verify OT's information. The scope of the monitoring was to include topics such as pasture, water, soil, vegetation, dust, wildlife, Undai river, Khaliv-Dugat river flow, TSF seepage, and possible downstream impacts from the OT mine. ","This commitment is IN PROGRESS  and involves ongoing implementation. The original commitment stated that implementation of monitoring activities would begin in January of 2018. In November 2017 the TPC agreed to give a monitoring contract to Munkh Nogoon Galba NGO, an organization that was specifically formed to carry out this commitment. However, monitoring activities were significantly delayed in large part because the capacity building needs of this NGO have been much greater than anticipated and resources have been limited. In March of 2019, OT agreed to give the NGO a budget of MNT 330 million, with an additional MNT 52,420,000 approved for its 2020 work. Unfortunately, this budget is not enough to attract experienced engineers in environmental monitoring, so Munkh Nogoon Galba NGO hired 3 full-time monitoring staff who are all recent graduates in addition to a Director and administrative person. The staff needs time to be trained to conduct the environmental monitoring. OT has facilitated much of the staff's training--a fact which may cut against the purpose of this monitoring commitment to serve as a check or confirmation of OT’s own monitoring activities.  The EHT has asked their technical advisor to also participate in training of the NGO's staff but this training has yet to be scheduled.",in_progress
19,OT reports on progress of retrospective compensation arrangements,Monitoring,Y,N/A,Y,N,Quarterly,"OT's mine infrastructure displaced or negatively impacted a number of herder households who had either summer or winter camps within or near the mine and who used the pastures or water points impacted by the mine. In 2004, OT relocated and provided compensation to 10 herder households whose winter camps were in the path of mine infrastructure development. In 2011, OT identified 89 households whose winter camps would be impacted by additional mine infrastructure development and provided them with compensation packages for impacts to their livelihoods. Herders claimed that these compensation programs did not cover all directly impacted households, and that OT did not properly account for traditional seasonal household movements throughout the soum.  During the negotiation of herders’ complaint, a Multi-Disciplinary Team and Independent Expert Panel (MDT/IEP) published a Joint Fact Finding Report in 2017, which recommended that the TPC establish a Compensation Claims Committee to review retrospective claims and grant eligible herders with appropriate compensation under the 2004 and 2011 programs. These recommendations were adopted (see commitments #26 and 29) by the TPC, and OT agreed to provide regular reporting to the TPC and herders about the retrospective compensation.","This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The agreement states that OT will provide quarterly updates to the TPC and herders. In total, OT has received 232 claims – 157 of which were approved.

During this process, 11 herding households from the Javkhlant and Gaviluud baghs were relocated because their winter camps were within the licensed land or located in close proximity to the Project. These were the only herder households who received any compensation for mine impacts at the time. However, many impacts of the mining project were not considered, including: adequate replacement of winter camps capable of keeping animals warm through the winter months, the reduced quality and quantity of pasture available to animals due to mine infrastructure taking over pastureland or cutting off access to pastureland, diminished water resources available for animals, and diseases caused by increased dust from construction.","This commitment was COMPLETED in March of 2017. After filing their complaint to the CAO, the herders engaged in multiple mediated dialogue sessions with OT and the Soum government. During this dialogue, OT acknowledged that OT activities disrupted the lives of herders who graze their herds next to the OT mine site.
