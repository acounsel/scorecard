1,,Re-establish a grazing system to adjust for lost pasture,Pasture,N,Y,N,N,Plan developed by Q4 2017,"OT built its mine atop pasture lands where herders used to graze their animals. With the loss of this land, pasture is more scarce. OT and the Khanbogd Soum government agreed to come up with a new pasture use plan to mitigate the effects of overcrowding and overgrazing.",delayed,"This commitment is DELAYED. An updated pasture use plan has not yet been approved by the Soum Khural. A professional organization developed a recommendation for pasture management. However, when it presented this plan at Bagh meetings, the major recommendation to divide herders into pasture “user groups” was rejected by herders.  To fulfill this commitment, the TPC must continue their efforts to re-establish a grazing system, working in close consultation with herders to develop a pasture use plan that meets their needs. In April of 2020, the TPC developed an action plan to do consultations with herders in the near future with the goal of educating herders on the pasture management plan and generate ideas specific to the Gobi desert.  This measure is needed to address ongoing issues with pasture crowding and should be coordinated with related commitments to build new wells (#12) particularly in areas where it could open up additional pastures (#3).",delayed,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 40% i.e. IN PROGRESS: The Pasture management plan for Khanbogd soum was developed by a professional organization in 2019. This is a project with financing of 320 million tugrugs provided by “Goviin Oyu” DSF and implemented in the territories of four eastern soums of Umnugovi aimag. The organization that developed the Pasture Management Plan presented it to TPC and herders, and it was not supported by the herders at the bagh citizens’ public meetings. A detailed action plan on measures to be taken in the future has been developed at April 2020 meeting of TPC."
2,,Reduce herder actions to lock wells / limit pasture access (signed user contracts),Pasture,Y,N/A,N,N,237 signed contracts by Q3 2017,"The OT mine's use of water and pasture lands has increased pressure on herders for these important resources. In order to protect increasingly scarce water and pasture, some herders had resorted to locking state-owned wells and restricting access to land. The Khanbogd Soum government with support from the TPC committed to sign contracts with 237 herders to ensure free and open access to state owned water points and land.",delayed,"This commitment is DELAYED. The original timeline in the agreement called for contracts to be signed with all users of state owned water access points by Q3 2017. Contract language has been approved by the TPC. However, the government’s plan clarified that contracts will only apply to engineered or deep wells (not shallow or hand wells).  As of the publishing of this update, no contracts have been signed yet.",not_started,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 70% i.e. GOOD FULFILLMENT: As of April 2020, a preparation is completed to sign contracts with all well possessors. Local government is planning to conclude contracts only for wells with engineering construction. "
3,,Open additional pasture use through well building program (#12); clarify herder rights to possession,Pasture,N,N/A,N,N,Irrigate all reserve pastures by 2018,"To address increased scarcity of water and pasture, the Khanbogd Soum government with support from OT agreed to build new wells on reserve pastureland (see commitment #12), with a goal to make more pastureland accessible for regular use by herders. These changes were to be reflected in a Soum government pasture irrigation policy and pasture use plan (see commitment #1). This commitment also includes clarifying herders' rights to possession regarding any new wells built.",not_started,This commitment is NOT YET STARTED. The commitment called for the irrigation of all possible reserve pastures by 2018. The reserve pastures have still not been identified. The TPC plans to identify reserve pastures and work towards building deep wells in those areas.The TPC should ensure that wells built carry out their intended purpose to open up additional land to herding.,not_started,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 0% i.e. NOT STARTED: A detailed action plan on measures to be taken in the future has been developed at April 2020 meeting of TPC. Since the establishment of Agreements on complaint resolution, works on building new wells and water points through OT financing are being carried out, therefore per OT assessment it is suggested to conclude the implementation as IN PROGRESS. Particularly, as of 4th quarter of 2019, OT handed over to local government 14 water exploration boreholes for herders use; there were newly built 5 hand wells and 7 deep drilled wells.  These water sources have provided some possibilities to use additional pastures improving pasture water supply and. "
4,,"Support local government on pasture management (technical trainings, provision of experts)",Pasture,Y,Y,Y,N,Send 5 experts to trainings by Q3 2017,"The Soum government, as a significant partner in the implementation of the agreements, committed to pursuing technical trainings of its staff on pasture and other related issues to build the local capacity of the government to support implementation of the agreements.",in_progress,"This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The original commitment called for five experts to be trained by Q3 of 2017. The Soum government has 5 staff positions that should be trained in pasture management, however, only one person was available for work when we visited in June 2019. Of the three staff hired to the Agricultural Department, two were on maternity leave. The government had to wait until October 2019 to hire two additional agricultural specialists in order to give them time to pass the public servant examination. Given changes in local government staffing, two additional specialists will need to trained to ensure the unit is sufficiently staffed with five trained experts.",not_started,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 90% i.e. GOOD FULFILLMENT: As of 4th quarter of 2017, all 5 members of working group on pasture monitoring have been involved in the training, so the commitment is completed. as of April 2020 TPC has concluded that there is a need to train 2 more specialists considering the changes in vacancies and work force of local government. Therefore, per OT assessment it is suggested to consider this commitment as COMPLETED."
5,,"TPC to actively support herders, existing institutions, and traditional ways to resolve herding conflicts",Pasture,N,N/A,N,N,Q3 2017,"In response to rising and at times violent disputes among herders related to water and pasture use, the Soum Governor issued a decree on open access to water points and prohibition on use of winter pastures during summer months. Under Mongolia law, water and pasture are generally for public use. It was thought that more was needed from the government to enforce the law and prevent restrictions on access. This commitment seeks to support herders in settling disputes about water and pasture using traditional and other mechanisms and requires the TPC to actively promote enforcement of the governor's decree.",not_started,"This commitment is NOT YET STARTED. It was thought that a resolution must be passed to help enforce the governor's decree, but trying to pass enforcement actions, such as fining those who restrict access to water points and pasture, is difficult to implement.  As an alternative, herder representatives to the TPC agreed to organize a campaign to promote the soum governor’s decree. The TPC should actively engage in support mechanisms to help herders resolve disputes.",not_started,According to PTC assessment the implementation is 70% i.e. GOOD FULFILLMENT: Herders’ representaives agreed to organize measures to introduce to the herders the ordinance issued by the Soum Governor. 
6,,Document and secure herder customary land and resource use rights (camp cadaster),Pasture,Y,N?,Y,Y,2018,"The government agreed to support herders to secure customary land rights by organizing a camp cadaster entry campaign. When herders register their camp, including any structures, in the cadaster, they receive a property certificate. This in turn allows herders to access credit by using their property as collateral.",in_progress,"This commitment was IN PROGRESS in 2019 and close to completion. The government organized a campaign in each bagh to complete the cadaster. As of April 2020, 373 herders (or about 80% of all registered herders) had their winter and spring camps mapped and registered.  Not all herders who requested registration of their camps had their camps included in the cadaster but any herder who still wants their camp mapped may do so by making a request at the government’s office in the Soum center.",in_progress,"According to PTC assessment the implementation is 80% i.e. GOOD FULFILLMENT:  As of April 2020, in total 373 herders (80%) have got cadastral maps for their winter or spring camps done. Local government is planning to complete cadastral mapping for the remaining winter or spring camps in the near future. Herders’ representatives shall carry out works to train and advocate herders on how to get land cadastral maps done."
7,,Detailed analysis of increased livestock numbers and absentee livestock ownership,Pasture,N,N,Y,N,List of livestock owners by Q4 2017,"As livestock numbers continue to rise, this puts greater urgency on the local government and herders to understand the growth in livestock and develop solutions for managing limited resources of pasture and water necessary for the livestock's survival. The government committed to carrying out a more detailed analysis of livestock numbers and “absentee owners” who hire other people to look after their herds. The stated goal was to achieve a clear understanding.",in_progress,"This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The government was supposed to have completed counting the livestock owning citizens in Q4 of 2017. The government has done this and now conducts an annual survey of livestock herded by others. However, it has not conducted any analysis, and is at the moment only monitoring livestock numbers. At the June 2019 TPC meeting, the TPC agreed to two additional steps to move this commitment forward: 1) conduct a study to collect data on Khanbogd soum livestock located in other soums and aimags; and 2) conduct a survey on the number of soum herders and the locations of livestock herded by others and use the information for pasture management. The TPC has marked this commitment as completed, but the commitment calls for more than just the collection of livestock numbers.  It requires analyzing data in an actionable way that will help them develop a better pasture management strategy. In response, the TPC has stated that the local government will conduct analysis on its data to inform the pasture management plan to be developed in commitment #1 on re-establishing a grazing system.",in_progress,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 100% i.e. COMPLETED.  Absentee livestock are registered in detail by livestock type, and a statistical analysis is being conducted during  the year end livestock census organized by the local government. This detailed information will be used by the local government to develop pasture management plan of Khanbogd soum – commitment stated in 1.1 of Agreement on herders’ complaint resolution.  "
8,,Consider and decide whether to build speed bumps around animal crossings on ОТ-KB road,Pasture,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,This commitment was discussed in the TPC and all parties agreed it was not necessary to implement this commitment.,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A
9,,Rehabilitate pasture in sites disturbed by past OT activities,Pasture,Y,Y,Y,N,2017-2027 in phases,"OT agreed to rehabilitate eight sites that were previously used by the mine. The purpose of rehabilitating these sites is to restore them to pasture-producing land, to shorten the time that these sites might produce dust if disturbed and to minimize risks of accidents in quarries. ",in_progress,"This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The time originally estimated for completing rehabilitation is 2017 to 2027. OT regularly reports to the TPC on rehabilitation progress, which for some areas will take years to complete.  As of May 2020, four of the eight sites have been rehabilitated, and another three are currently in progress. ",in_progress,According to TPC assessment the implementation is 70% i.e. GOOD FULFILLMENT: OT provides progress reports to TPC on regular basis on the works carried out on 8 sites identified for rehabilitation.
10,,Continue to implement 2015 protocol allowing temporary livestock grazing within OT fence,Pasture,Y,N/A,Y,Y,Ongoing,"When OT built its mine, it placed a fence around its production facilities and prevented herders from grazing their animals on their usual pastures. With this commitment, OT agreed to allow herders to continue grazing their animals in certain areas within the fenced production site of OT. OT has stated in the agreement that this is a temporary situation and the grazing area may not be available for use in the future once mine expansion plans get underway.",completed,This commitment is COMPLETED and involves ongoing implementation. The TPC should continue to monitor whether the area inside the fence is available for grazing and whether herders are aware of the option to use this grazing area.,completed,According to TPC assessment the implementation is 100% i.e. COMPLETED:TPC identified this commitment as a work to be carried out continuously. 
11,,Request national government to allocate 50% of OT's water use fee to KB Soum Government,Water,N,N,N,N,Receive response by Q3 2017,"The government of Mongolia charges a fixed rate to mining companies for the water they use in their operations. This ""water use fee"" is paid to the national government, which distributes a portion to the national budget, and a portion to the aimag, provincial government, where the mine is located. The aimag then apportions that money across the soums in its territories. Though the herders and citizens of Khanbogd soum are the ones most impacted by OT's mining activities and use of local water resources, they receive a disproportionately low percentage of the water use fee paid by OT. Both OT and the Khanbogd soum government agreed to lobby to request that 50% of the water use fee paid by OT gets re-allocated back to Khanbogd soum.",delayed,"This commitment is DELAYED. The Khanbogd government submitted a letter to the aimag citizen’s khural in support of an amendment to the law that would distribute 50% of OT's water use fee to the local soum. Unfortunately, there has been no response at the national or aimag level to pass the legislation needed to make this change. Getting additional support to the soum government is vitally important to accomplish other commitments in the Agreements (most notably to implement the soum’s Animal Husbandry Sector Development Program commitment #34). It is unclear whether OT and the Khanbogd Soum can find a way to get more of the water use fee to go to the soum or possibly find another way to get more resources to the soum.",delayed,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 70% i.e. GOOD FULFILLMENT: Local government administration has submitted a written request to Aimag citizens’ representatives’ khural and the Government of Mongolia. It is not possible to retain locally a certain percentage of water fee until the appropriate laws of Mongolia are amended. TPC’s decision to consider the implementation of this commitment as good is made in compliance with the performance criteria agreed upon the Agreement, i.e, to send a request to Aimag CRKH and get a  response."
12,,"Construct new hand wells across 4 baghs, based on findings of hydrological studies (see #17)*",Water,Y,Y,N,N,Begin well construction in 2018,"OT agreed to build new hand wells across the soum as a form of collective compensation to herders. The exact number of wells was to be determined by the TPC based on hydrological studies to ensure that wells would be productive and would not affect water levels of existing wells. The agreement further states that the well locations should incorporate input from herders and should be dispersed across the four baghs to encourage migration and use of alternate pastures and allow herders to continue their customary livelihood practices. An independent <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-12"">joint fact-finding report></a> commissioned by the TPC and published in January of 2017, whose findings were the basis of the Final Agreement commitments, recommended that 75+ hand wells would be needed to address herders’ water needs. The TPC later agreed to combine commitments #12 and #17 and implement “a project to conduct pastureland water geophysical survey and drillings, restore wells, and build new wells.”  They also agreed to coordinate this work with commitments #1 and #3.",in_progress,"This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The agreement contemplated a new well construction program beginning in 2018 after completion of a hydrological study. Instead of financing the construction of wells directly, OT submitted a request for funding through the <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-12"">Gobi Oyu Development Support Fund (DSF)</a>, an aimag-wide fund for community development projects to which OT contributes $5 million annually. The governing body of the Gobi Oyu Development Support Fund has many stakeholders with competing interests. DSF approved the Chandmani Erdene project to conduct a hydrological study to find water pools on non-irrigated land. The scope of this project, however, was expanded across four soums in the South Gobi aimag and is not solely focused on Khanbogd soum and implementation of this commitment. As a result, the funding and scope for this project are limited and it only contemplates building 12 new wells in Khanbogd Soum (6 deep wells; 1 solar powered well; 5 hand wells). This falls far short of the 75+ hand wells recommended by the independent study. As of the writing of this report, the 12 new wells were constructed, but it is not clear that they are being built in a manner that encourages migration and use of alternate pastures as specified by the agreement.  Given that a full hydrological study was never undertaken to establish how many new wells are needed to meet herder water needs in Khanbogd soum, it is not clear how TPC will assess whether the new wells are sufficient, or whether they will consider further action to address herders’ water needs beyond the 12 wells provided through the Chandmani Erdene Project.",in_progress,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 20% i.e. it is STARTED. It will be further implemented in conjunction with provisions 1.1 and 1.3 of Agreement 1 on complaint resolution. The detailed action plan was discussed at TPC meeting and a decision was made. Since the establishment of Agreements on complaint resolution, works on building new wells and water points through OT financing are being carried out, therefore per OT assessment it is suggested to conclude the implementation as IN PROGRESS. Particularly, as of 4th quarter of 2019, OT handed over to local government 14 water exploration boreholes for herders use; there were newly built 5 hand wells and 7 deep drilled wells.  These water sources have provided some possibilities to use additional pastures improving pasture water supply and.  "
13,,"Establish well maintenance team to build, repair and monitor condition of wells (see # 37)",Water,N,Y,N,N,Proof of restored wells by Q4 2017,"Many current wells have not been renovated since the early 1990s. Herders are able to do annual or biannual removal of mud from shallow wells, but deep wells are difficult for herders to maintain on their own. OT agreed to collaborate with the Khanbogd soum government to set up a well maintenance team, which would also benefit herders by providing them employment.",delayed,"This commitment is DELAYED. The agreement timeline originally contemplated reporting of results of restored wells by Q4 of 2017. The commitment has been delayed because of a lack of capacity within the TPC to develop options for how to structure the well maintenance program. After heavy rains in 2018, six herder cooperatives were hired to conduct emergency repairs of 40 wells. The TPC is looking to the Chandmani Erdene Project to continue making repairs of wells.  However, the Chandmani Erdene project repaired only 1 deep well and 10 hand wells in 2018 and 2019. The TPC discussed the need for well maintenance to begin in the Spring of 2020, but it’s unclear what additional actions beyond relying on the Chandmani Erdene project will be taken to fulfill this commitment.  The TPC responded that an additional 10-15 wells will be repaired under the Chandmani Erdene project in 2020 and that a closed tender would be organized among the businesses in Khanbogd soum to repair the wells and livestock shelters.",delayed,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 20% i.e. it is STARTED:In the framework of Chandmana Erdene project, there were repaired a total of 10 hand wells and 1 deep drilled well during 2018-2019. In 2020, 10-15 more wells will be repaired under Chandmana Erdene project. It was decided at TPC meeting that following further the Chandmana Erdene project a closed tender selection will be organized among entities of Khanbogd soum for repair of wells and livestock shelters. A detailed action plan on measures to be taken in the future has been discussed and agreed upon at TPC meeting."
14,,Gradually stop OT water delivery after resolving new well creation needs,Water,N,N/A,Y,Y,2018,"There is a wide-held belief among herders that water levels in wells and well recharge rates have decreased in part due to OT's use of local water resources. During negotiations about the herders’ CAO complaints, OT began delivering water tanks to 5 designated locations, to serve herder households who did not have sufficient access to water from local wells. OT agreed to continue delivering water to these households until they obtained sufficient access to water through the construction of new wells as contemplated in commitment #12.",completed,"This commitment is COMPLETED. The original timeline noted that the temporary delivery should stop once new wells were built based on commitment #12. TPC agreed that OT would temporarily stop its delivery of water after heavy rains in 2018 made the water deliveries unnecessary for most households receiving this benefit. Though the well-building effort (commitment #12) is still in progress, OT decided to build wells at six water points to provide a sustainable alternative to the water deliveries. The TPC established a working group consisting of members of the Aimag Food and Agriculture Department, the Governor's Office of Khanbogd Soum, the TPC, the well-building company, the herders who own the wells, and members of the Galba Oosh Dolood Basin Administration to assess the performance and quality of the wells.  There were problems with two of the water points not producing sufficient water.  In response to these issues, OT agreed to rebuild one of the wells and continues to provide water deliveries at another water point.",completed,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 100% i.e. COMPLETED: As for the well performance and quality – mentioned here – there was established a working group by  TPC decision and an inspection was conducted using a joint fact finding methodology. The working group was comprising of representatives from Aimag’s Food Agriculture Department, Soum government, TPC members, project implementing organization, Galba, Uush, Dolood river basin administration as well as herders, the well possessors. The working group’s conclusion was produced in February 2020; and it was concluded that these wells meet the standard technical requirements on wells for pasture water supply and are functioning normally. At the moment, there is no herder  household who gets water delivery. Water transportation was fully stopped since November 2019 and this commitment was considered as fully completed at the TPC meeting in April."
15,,Close all leaking boreholes in Gunii Khooloi area; equip 2 fountaining boreholes for herders’ water use,Water,Y,Y,Y,Y,2016,"This commitment included closing all leaking boreholes in the Gunii Khooloi area.  This was important to herders, as some OT boreholes had previously been found to leak water from shallow aquifers that herders rely on into deeper aquifers used by OT, contributing to an unknown amount of water loss. OT also agreed to equip 2 boreholes for use by herders, and equipping two boreholes to enable herders to use them for household water needs.",completed,"This commitment was COMPLETED in March 2019. OT has now sealed a total of 55 old exploration boreholes, in collaboration with Khanbogd soum, South Gobi aimag and the TPC. All sealed boreholes have been officially handed over to the Galba-Uush Doloodiin river basin authority and the Khanbogd Soum government.",completed,According to TPC assessment the implementation is 100% i.e. COMPLETED: 
16,,"Provide 12 boreholes, equipped for herder water use, to KB Government",Water,Y,Y,Y,Y,Q3 2017,OT agreed to hand over 12 exploration boreholes in the Gunii Khooloi area (in addition to the 2 in commitment #15) and Galbyn Gobi to the Khanbogd Soum government for use by local herders for their pastoral water supply needs.,completed,This commitment was COMPLETED in March 2019.,not_started,According to TPC assessment the implementation is 100% i.e. COMPLETED:
17,,Hydrogeological study (study of water reserves under pasture)*,Water,Y,Y,Y,N,Q2-Q3 2017,"The parties originally agreed that OT would fund a hydrological study that would map the water reserves under pastures in Khanbogd Soum and provide the basis for implementing the new well-building program. This was based on the recommendation of the Multi-Disciplinary Team and Independent Expert Panel (MDT/IEP) Joint Fact Finding Report published in 2017.  The TPC was to define the Terms of Reference of the study. The goal of this study was to quantify OT’s current and future impacts on water by providing an understanding of shallow groundwater dynamics on which herders depend, by strengthening modelling, and by measuring changes in water resources. The TPC subsequently decided to combine commitments #12 and #17 and implement a project to conduct pastureland water geophysical survey and drillings, restore wells, and build new wells. The TPC decided to fund the geophysical survey and well building program through the Gobi Oyu Social Development Fund as part of the Chandmani Erdene project (see commitment #12).",delayed,"This commitment is DELAYED. Because the geophysical survey and well building are being paid for and implemented through the Gobi Oyu Social Development Fund, this commitment has been subjected to a longer process that is not in the control of the TPC or the parties. This commitment has now been rolled into a larger project to improve pasture watering across four soums. It is unclear how the geophysical survey will be conducted, whether it will cover the full territory of Khanbogd Soum or only limited areas around each planned water point, or what information such a survey will be able to provide. With so many unknowns and so few decisions in the hands of the TPC, it is far from clear whether this commitment will achieve its intended purpose.",not_started,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 20% i.e. it is STARTED: It will be implemented in conjunction with provisions 1.1 and 1.3 of Agreement 1 on complaint resolution. The funding for point –based geophysical survey will be included in the budget of any well building project thus enabling reduction of risks such as dry drilling etc. A detailed action plan was discussed and agreed upon at TPC meeting. The funding for point –based geophysical survey will be included in the budget of any well building project thus enabling reduction of risks such as dry drilling etc. For instance, well construction works have been successfully completed thanks to the inclusion of the fund for point based geophysical survey in the budget of Chandmana Erdene project.

18,,Replace outsourced environmental monitoring with local monitoring; include paid positions for herders*,"Monitoring, reporting, and community relations",Y,Y,Y,N,Begin to implement in January 2018,"There have been many disputes between herders and OT about the reliability of OT's environmental monitoring data. For example, OT and herders have long disagreed on whether the mine has had an impact on water resources used by herders. The parties agreed to establish a participatory monitoring program, in which herders could independently verify OT's information. The scope of the monitoring was to include topics such as pasture, water, soil, vegetation, dust, wildlife, Undai river, Khaliv-Dugat river flow, TSF seepage, and possible downstream impacts from the OT mine. The parties agreed that the program would incorporate a joint fact-finding methodology to ensure scientific rigor, accessibility, and credibility. This should include genuine involvement by herders, who are to be paid for their monitoring work. The monitoring program developed should be sensitive to herding practices to enable maximum participation by herders. It should include capacity building of local specialized organizations and herders in professional monitoring practices. The monitoring program should present its work regularly to herders in a manner that is direct, understandable, and relevant. Findings should be presented at all Baghs and in the Soum center.",in_progress,"This commitment is IN PROGRESS and involves ongoing implementation. The original commitment stated that implementation of monitoring activities would begin in January of 2018. In November 2017 the TPC agreed to give a monitoring contract to Munkh Nogoon Galba NGO, an organization that was specifically formed to carry out this commitment. However, monitoring activities were significantly delayed in large part because the capacity building needs of this NGO have been much greater than anticipated and resources have been limited. In March of 2019, OT agreed to give the NGO a budget of MNT 330 million, with an additional MNT 52,420,000 approved for its 2020 work. Unfortunately, this budget is not enough to attract experienced engineers in environmental monitoring, so Munkh Nogoon Galba NGO hired 3 full-time monitoring staff who are all recent graduates in addition to a Director and administrative person. The staff needs time to be trained to conduct the environmental monitoring. OT has facilitated much of the staff's training--a fact which may cut against the purpose of this monitoring commitment to serve as a check or confirmation of OT’s own monitoring activities. The EHT has asked their technical advisor to also participate in training of the NGO's staff but this training has yet to be scheduled. Equipment and training needs have delayed most monitoring activities. Water level monitoring has begun and involves approximately 68 herders. The NGO also recently started its animal/wildlife monitoring, which involves 16 herders and pasture monitoring, which involves 8 herders. The full monitoring plan can be found here.[include MNG NGO work plan]. Sample results are being reported in <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-18"">OT’s monthly newsletter</a>, but full reporting of monitoring results has yet to be publicly shared with herders as contemplated by this commitment.",in_progress,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 100% i.e. COMPLETED: TPC identified this commitment as a work to be carried out continuously. The monitoring plan of NGO is reviewed and approved by TPC and EHT consultants; As suggested by TPC the 2020 budget was amended increasing the budget amount; 2019 Monitoring report is produced in Mongolian. The results of participatory environmental monitoring, its reports and data are disseminated to the public through all available channels, from bagh meetings to social networks; the herders and the public are provided with information and advocacy. Capacity building for local NGO is a part of the commitment obligated by the Agreement. The local NGO has contracted 4 specialists as monitoring advisors who will provide trainings and consultations including trainings for herders participating in monitoring works.

In 2004, OT relocated and provided compensation to 10 herder households whose winter camps were in the path of mine infrastructure development. In 2011, OT identified 89 households whose winter camps would be impacted by additional mine infrastructure development and provided them with compensation packages for impacts to their livelihoods. Herders claimed that these compensation programs did not cover all directly impacted households, including those with spring camps and those who shared camps with other households. During the negotiation of herders’ complaint, a Multi-Disciplinary Team and Independent Expert Panel (MDT/IEP) published a Joint Fact Finding Report in 2017, which recommended that the TPC establish a Compensation Claims Committee to review retrospective claims and grant eligible herders with appropriate compensation under the 2004 and 2011 programs. These recommendations were adopted (see commitments #26 and 29) by the TPC, and OT agreed to provide regular reporting to the TPC and herders about the retrospective compensation.",in_progress,"This commitment is IN PROGRESS. The agreement states that OT will provide quarterly updates to the TPC and herders. In total, OT has received 232 claims – 157 of which were approved. As of April 2020, OT has paid out USD 1.2 million to 148 households in individual compensation claims. This includes compensation for 32 families whose winter shelters were impacted, 73 families whose spring locations were impacts, and 52 families who were sharing locations with other herding families but had not been separately compensated.",in_progress,"According to TPC assessment the implementation is 95% i.e. GOOD FULFILLMENT: TPC have received a total of 232 claims, and the decisions to provide compensation were made in favor of 157 claims that were considered eligible. As of April 2020, approximately USD 1.2 mln are provided to 148 households with whom contracts were signed.OT have provided compensations to all households affected in 2004 and 2011. Herders have filed compliants to IFC and the parties sat at negotiation table and it was the beginning towards TPC.

Three such projects around maintenance work have been grouped and described below: A Well Maintenance Brigade Establishment Project will establish a team of local herders and professional organizations to provide well maintenance work on hand wells and deep wells. (See commitment #37). A Khoroo/Camp fence Maintenance Team Establishment Project will establish a team of local herders to carry out livestock shelter construction and maintenance works. An Artificial lake, Pond, and Water Collection Points Project will identify areas in each Bagh where it is possible to create water collection points and where water points need to be restored based on herders’ suggestions.",delayed,"This commitment is DELAYED. Though OT approved MNT 200 million in funding for the project in 2019, this commitment has been delayed because of a lack of capacity within the TPC to develop options for how to structure the well maintenance program. After heavy rains in 2018, six herder cooperatives were hired to conduct emergency repairs of 40 wells.  TheTPC is looking to the Chandmani Erdene Project to continue making repairs of wells.  However, the Chandmani Erdene project repaired only 1 deep well and 10 hand wells in 2018 and 2019.    The TPC discussed the need for well maintenance to begin in the Spring of 2020, but it’s unclear what additional actions beyond relying on the Chandmani Erdene project will be taken to fulfill this commitment.  The TPC responded that an additional 10-15 wells will be repaired under the Chandmani Erdene project in 2020 and that a closed tender would be organized among the businesses in Khanbogd soum to repair the wells and livestock shelters. Regarding the Water Points Project, OT had envisioned that this TPC commitment would be carried out through the ""Water the Precious Gem"" project through the Gobi Oyu Development Support Fund (DSF). Going through the DSF has created challenges including delays and lack of control over how the project is implemented. Most recently, in late 2019 the TPC was working to collect data on current ponds and catchments within Khanbogd Soum, as a basis for further discussion of next steps.",delayed,It was agreed that besides Chandmana Erdene project a closed tender selection will be organized among entities of Khanbogd soum for repair of wells and livestock shelters. A detailed action plan has been discussed and approved by TPC. Creation of artificial lake was not included in the terms of reference of Chandmana Erdene project at all and it was mutually understood within TPC that creation of artificial lake is to be governed by different regulations separate from well repair work.
