Achievement,3,Connecting Herders to Markets,"Though many of the collective compensation projects meant to provide broader support to indirectly impacted herders are stalled, the TPC cleared a major hurdle when herders voted for the management structure to govern the slaughterlinehouse and herders’ market.  Learn about the <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-38"">herders’ market.</a> and <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-42"">slaughterline</a>",,,https://scorecard-static.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/private/images/OT_mine_site.jpg

Achievement,6,Preserving Traditional Herding ,"As of June 2019, 36 seniors were participating in a project to share traditional herding practices with younger herders. The TPC along with the Elders’ Council agreed to extend and expand the project. Learn about <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-59"">elder herder's project.</a>",,,https://scorecard-static.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/private/images/goats.jpg
Achievement,7,Participatory Monitoring ,"Munkh Nogoon Galba, a non-governmental organization of local herders and young professionals, has developed a <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-18"">participatory monitoring</a> plan, which they are starting to implement in stages and currently involves nearly 100 herders.",,,https://scorecard-static.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/private/images/herderssewing.jpg
Achievement,8,Livelihood Support,"Under the Sustainable Livelihoods Support Program, a total of about 60 herder households will be able to earn additional income. The garment business, founded by herder women who participated in one of these compensation programs, won an international award in 2019.",,,https://scorecard-static.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/private/images/mandal_dorjkhand.jpeg
Challenge,1,Accountability,"The TPC discussed the need to set up an independent monitoring body to evaluate and monitor the TPC’s progress on commitments.  An independent monitoring body can bring transparency to the process and build trust with the herding community. The TPC has recently re-committed to take this step in the near future, and we encourage them to realize this goal. Greater accountability can also be achieved with updated and realistic timelines. The TPC has not provided updates on estimated time frames to the public since 2017 and as of May 2020, <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-1"">~26 commitments are delayed or not started</a>.",,"There are other commitments referenced in the challenge besides 1 that aren't captured by the hyperlink such as delayed commitments like: 2, 11, 13, 17, 28, 34C, 34D, 34I, 42, 44, 53, 55 and not started commitments suh as: 3, 5, 34J, 34L, 34K, 34M, 40, 45",https://scorecard-static.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/private/images/munkhchuluum.jpg
Challenge,2,Greater Transparency,"Transparency around implementation and the mine’s ongoing operations is important for building trust with the herding community.  While OT has completed its obligation to improve its grievance mechanism on paper, more must be done to ensure the process is accessible and understood by the herders.  For many, when and how complaints should be brought directly to OT versus to the broader TPC remains unclear.  Other commitments that could benefit from greater transparency include participatory environmental monitoring and tailings storage facility.",,,https://scorecard-static.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/media/private/images/namsrai_1.jpg
Challenge,3,Management of Projects,"Relying on outside parties to execute projects risks losing control over the implementation process and outcomes, and may result in final projects that do not meet herders’ needs.  Herders have argued at length about the ownership and management of some of these projects, like the <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-38"">herders’ market</a> and <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-42"">slaughterline</a>, which have a goal to benefit herders broadly.  A recent herder election decided that these two major projects would be managed by a large cooperative comprising smaller cooperatives from each bagh, but questions still remain as the cooperatives have not yet been selected.  Other projects, such as well maintenance, still have not begun to resolve the question of who will implement the project.",,,
Challenge,4,Narrow Interpretations,"At times, commitments have been interpreted in a way that falls short of meeting the underlying goals of the Agreement.  For example, the agreement calls for re-establishing a <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-1"">grazing system</a> to adjust for lost pasture.  The Khanbogd government developed a plan, but it was largely rejected by herders and no new plan has been proposed.  The TPC had previously marked this commitment as complete even though the commitment was intended to implement a plan that addresses pasture scarcity.  However, the TPC has recently reopened this commitment and is now looking at alternative approaches to implement it.  This has also been an issue with <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-12"">construction of new wells</a>.",,,
Challenge,5,Pivoting on Commitments,"Implicit assumptions baked into some commitments have not been realized, leading to uncertainty on the path forward to complete those commitments. For example, the agreement provides for a <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-40"">fodder planting project</a>, but the TPC later realized that it was cost-prohibitive to plant fodder in the Soum.  The TPC has been open to receiving an alternative plan to the fodder planting project, but received no submissions.  We encourage the TPC to take a more proactive role in seeking input from herders and experts to replace this commitment with an equivalent benefit to the herder community.",,,
Challenge,6,Process Delays,"Funding through Gobi Oyu Fund is likely to lead to further delays and scope drift.  The Gobi Oyu Fund receives funding from OT but is not controlled by the TPC. Though this has not been true of all commitments receiving funding through the Fund, <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-12"">construction of new wells</a> is one example of a commitment that was expected to be funded through this Fund and was later wrapped up in an Aimag-wide project that only committed to building 12 wells instead of the 75+ recommended by an independent study.  The <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-17"">hydrogeological study</a> and <a href=""/commitments#commitment-34"">Soum Development Program</a> have been similarly impacted.",,,
Challenge,7,Resource Constraints,"Capacity and resource constraints in the government can lead to further delays in commitments.  As a result of these constraints commitments where the Soum government is the responsible party, such as the <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-34c"">animal laboratory</a>, have been delayed, and the government has not been able to fully staff its <a href=""/commitments/#commitment-4"">pasture management</a> unit.",,,
Challenge,8,Recent Elections,"Recent elections of the Elected Herder Team have added uncertainty to the TPC’s work, which at a minimum is likely to slow agreement implementation.",,,
Recommendation,1,"Increase transparency and improve communication with the local herding community, ","Increase transparency and improve communication with the local herding community, including through regular updates on implementation status and expected timelines. Without improvement, poor information flow leads to suspicion and confusion and may prevent the most vulnerable herders from sharing in Agreement benefits. ",,,
Recommendation,2,"Establish a robust, independent monitoring and review mechanism, ",to ensure the TPC remains accountable and carries out the Agreement commitments in full. Monitoring should focus on whether implementation of each commitment has achieved its intended purpose and include recommendations to help TPC overcome obstacles.,,,
Recommendation,3,"Ensure that all Agreement commitments are implemented in line with their agreed purpose and intent, ","Ensure that all Agreement commitments are implemented in line with their agreed purpose and intent, even where unforeseen challenges may require modifications. If herding is to be sustained, pasture and water commitments should be prioritized with a focus on meeting herders’ needs.",,,
Recommendation,4,"Closely monitor and maintain control over commitments funded or carried out by third parties,","to avoid the risk of projects drifting from their intended purpose, timeline and scope",,,
Recommendation,5,"Continue to improve the capacity and commitment of TPC representatives,",considering that newly elected TPC members may benefit from need more training on TPC duties and practices and that 2020 is a local election year which may introduce influences that distract all local stakeholders from the TPC’s agenda.,,,
